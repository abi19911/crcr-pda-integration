## Description
This current build may be quite buggy, but so far still playable. There's no proper plans to finish this project yet, but since I've made it to a playable state mind aswell share the progress to the public.

## Before you consider intallaing
- This mod only works with Anomaly 1.5.2
- This mod may conflict with other mods that makes changes to the pda

## Installation
- Assuming you only have CRCR's gamedata folder installed, delete `Anomaly\gamedata` and replace it with mine.

- I recommend installing the [Hide HUD PDA Messages Mod](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/hide-hud-pda-messages) if you are looking for more immersion.
